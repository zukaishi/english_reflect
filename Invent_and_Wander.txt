I AM OFTEN ASKED woh, of the people living today,
I would consider to be in the same league as those I have written about as biographer:Leonardo da Vinci,Benjamin Franklin, 
Ada Lovelace,Steve Jobs, and Albert Einstein.All were very smart.But that's not what made them special.
Smart people are a dime a dozen and often don't amount to much.What counts is being creative and  imaginative.
That's what makes someone a true innovator.And that's whey my answer to the question is Jeft Bezos.

So,what are the ingredients of creativity and imagination,and what makes me think that Bezos belongs in the same league as my other subjects?

The first is to be curious,passionately curious.Take Leonardo.In his delight-filled notebooks we see his mind dancing across all fields of nature with a curiosity this is exuberant and playful,He asks and tries to answer hundreds of charmingly random questions:Why is the sky blue? What does the tongue of a woodpecker look like? Do a birds's wings move faster when flapping down? How is the pattern of swirling water similar to that of curling hair? Is the muscle of the bottom lip connected to that of the top lip?
Leonardo did not need to know there things to paint the Mona Lisa(thought it helped); he needed to know them because the was Leonardo, always obsessively curious. "I have to special talent," Einstein once said. "I am only passionately curious." That's not fully true(he certainly did have special talent), but he was right when he said,
"Curiosity is more important that knowledge."

A second key trait is to love and to connect the arts sciences. Whenever Steve Jobs launched a new product such as the iPod or Iphone, his presentation ended with street signs that showed an intersection of Liberal Arts Street and Technology Street. "It's in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough," he said at one of these presentations. "We believe that it's technology married with the humanities that yields us the result that makes our heart sing."
