I AM OFTEN ASKED woh, of the people living today,
I would consider to be in the same league as those I have written about as biographer:Leonardo da Vinci,Benjamin Franklin, 
Ada Lovelace,Steve Jobs, and Albert Einstein.All were very smart.But that's not what made them special.
Smart people are a dime a dozen and often don't amount to much.What counts is being creative and  imaginative.
That's what makes someone a true innovator.And that's whey my answer to the question is Jeft Bezos.

So,what are the ingredients of creativity and imagination,
and what makes me think that Bezos belongs in the same league as my other subjects?

The first is to be curious,passionately curious.Take Leonardo.
In his delight-filled notebooks we see his mind dancing across all fields of nature with a curiosity this is exuberant and playful,He asks and tries to answer hundreds of charmingly random questions:Why is the sky blue? 
What does the tongue of a woodpecker look like? Do a birds's wings move faster when flapping down? 
How is the pattern of swirling water similar to that of curling hair?
Is the muscle of the bottom lip connected to that of the top lip?
Leonardo did not need to know there things to paint the Mona Lisa(thought it helped); he needed to know them because the was Leonardo, always obsessively curious. 
"I have to special talent," Einstein once said.
"I am only passionately curious." That's not fully true(he certainly did have special talent), 
but he was right when he said,"Curiosity is more important that knowledge."

A second key trait is to love and to connect the arts sciences. 
Whenever Steve Jobs launched a new product such as the iPod or Iphone, 
his presentation ended with street signs that showed an intersection of Liberal Arts Street and Technology Street. 
"It's in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough,
"he said at one of these presentations. 
"We believe that it's technology married with the humanities that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.
"Einstein,likewise,realized how important is to interweave the arts and the sciences.When he felt stymied in his quest for the theory of general relativity,
he would pull out his violin and play Mozart,saying that the music helped concert him to the harmony of the spheres.
From Leonardo da Vinci,we have the greatest symbol of this connection between the arts and sciences:
Vitruvian Man, his drawing of a nude male standing in a circle and square,a triumph of anatomy, math,beauty, and spirituality.

In fact, it helps to be excited by all disciplines.Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin wanted to know everything you could possibly know about everything that was knowable.
They studied anatomy and botany and music and art and weaponry and water engineering and everything in between.
People who love all fields of knowledge are the ones who can best sport the patterns that exist across nature.
Both Franklin and Leonardo were fascinated by whirlwinds and swirling water.
That helped Franklin figure out how storms move up the coast and to chart the Gulf Stream.
It helped Leonardo understand how the heart value works as well as to paint both the water rippling by the ankles of Jesus in the Baptism of Christ and the curls of the Mona Lisa.

Another characteristic of truly innovative and creative people is that they have a reality-distortion field,
a phrase that was used about Steve Jobs and comes from a Start Trek episode in which aliens create an entire new world through sheer mental force.
When his colleagues protested that one of job's ideas or proposals would be impossible to implement,
he would use a trick he learned from a guru in India: he would stare at them without blinking and say,
"Don't be afraid. You can do it." It usually worked. He drove people mad, he drove them to distraction,
but he also drove them to do things they didn't believe they could do.

Related to that is the ability to "think different," as Jobs put it in a memorable set of Apple ads.
The science community at the beginning of the twentieth century was puzzling over how the speed of light seemed to remain constant no matter how fast the observer was moving toward or away from the source.
At the time Albert Einstein was a third-class patent clerk in Switzerland who was studying devices that sent signals between different clocks in order to synchronize them.
He came up with an out-of-the-box thought based on his realization that people who were in different states of motion would have different perceptions of whether the clocks were synchronized.
Perhaps the speed of light is always constant,he theorized,because time itself is relative depending on one's state of motion.
It took the rest of the physics community a few years to realize that this "theory of relativity" was right.

One final trait shared by all my subjects is that they retained a childlike sense of wonder.
At a certain point in life most of us quit puzzling over everyday phenomena.Our teachers and parents,
becoming impatient,tell us to stop asking so many silly questions.We might savor the beauty of blue sky,
but we no longer bother to wonder why it is that color.Leonardo did.So did Einstein,who wrote to another friend,
"You and I never cease to stand like curious children before the great mystery into which we were born."
We should be careful to never outgrow our wonder years-or to let our children do so.

Jeft Bezos embodies these traits.He has never outgrown his wonder years.He retains an insatiable,
childlike, and joyful curiosity about almost everything. 
His interest in narrative and storytelling not only comes from Amazon's roots in the bookselling business;
it is also a personal passion. As a kid, Bezos read dozens of science fiction novels each summer at a local library,and he now hosts an annual retreat for writers and moviemakers.
Likewise, although his interest in robotics and artificial intelligence was sparked because of Amazon,
these fields have grown to become intellectual passions,and he now hosts another gathering each year that brings together experts interested in machine learning, automation, robotics, and space.He collects historical artifacts form great moments in science, exploration, and discovery.
And he connects this loe of the humanities and his passion for technology to his instinct for business.

That trifecta-humanities,technology, business-is what has made him one of our era's most successful and influential innovators.
Like Steve Jobs,Bezos has transformed multiple industries.Amazon, the world's largest online retailer,has changed how we shop and what we expect of shipping and deliveries.
More that half of US households are members of Amazon Prime,and Amazon delivered ten billion packages in 2018,which is two billion more than the number of people on this planet.
Amazon Web Services(AWS) provides cloud computing services and applications that enable start-ups and established companies to easily create new products and services, just as the iPhone App Store opened whole new pathways for business.
Amazon's Echo has created a new market for smart home speakers,and Amazon Studios is making hit TV shows and movies.
Amazon is also poised to disrupt the health and pharmacy industries.At first its purchase of the Whole Foods Market chain was confounding,until it became apparent that the move could be a brilliant way to tie together the strands of a new Bezos business model, which involves retailing,online ordering,and super-fast delivery,combined with physical outposts.
Bezos is also building a private space company with the long-term goal of moving heavy industry to space, and he has become the owner of the Washington Post.

Of course, he also has some of the infuriating traits that distinguished Steve Jobs and others.
Despite his fame and influence, he has remained, behind his boisterous laugh,somewhat of an enigma.
But through his life tale and writings,it is possible to get a sense of what drives him.

When Jeft Bezos was a young kid-big eared, with a booming laugh and insatiable curiosity-he spent his summers on the sprawling South Texas ranch of his maternal grandfather,Lawrence Gise, an upright but loving naval commander who had helped develop the hydrogen bomb as an assistant director of the Atomic Energy Commission.
There Jeft learned self-reliance. When a bulldozer broke , he and his grandfather built a crane to lift out the gears and fix them.
Together they castrated the cattle,built windmills, laid pipe, and had long conversations about the frontiers of science,
technology,and space travel."He did all his own veterinary work," Bezos recalls. "He would make his own needles to suture up the cattle with.
He would take a piece of wire, use a blowtorch to heat it up, pound it flat, sharpen it, drill a hole through it--make a needle. 
Some of the cattle even survived."

Jeft was a voracious reader with an adventurous mind.His grandfather would take him to the library,
Which had a huge collection of science fiction books. Over the summers Jeft worked his way through the shelves, 
reading hundreds of them. Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein became his favorites,and later in life he would not only quote them but also occasionally invoke their rules lessons, and lingo.

His self-reliance and adventurous spirit were also insilled by Jeff's mother, Jackie, who was just as tenacious and sharp as her father and son.
She became pregnant with Jeft when she was only seventeen. "She was a high school student," Jeft explains.
"You're probably thinking, 'Wow in 1964 in Albuquerque, it was probably really cool to be a pregnant girl.'
No it wasn't. It took a lot of grit. And a lot of help from her parents. The high school actually even tried to kick her out of school.
I guess they thought pregnancy might be contagious.And my grandfather being a cool and wise guy negotiated a deal with the principal that allowed her to stay and finish hight school. "What was the main lesson Jeft learned from her?"
Your grow up with a mother like that and you have unbelievable grit," has says.

Jeft's biological father ran a bicycle store and performed in circus unicycle troupe.
He and Jackie were married only briefly.When Jeft was four,his mother remarried.
Her second husband was better match,a person who also taught Jeft the value or grit and determination:
Miguel Bezos, Known ass Mike. He, too, was self-reliant and adventurous.He had come to the United States at age sixteen as refugee from Fidel Castro's Cuba,traveling on his own and wearing a jacket his mother had sewed for him out of household rage.
After he married Jackie, he adopted her lively son,who took his last name and forever after considered him his real father.

As a five-year-old in july 1969, Jeft watched television coverage of the Apollo 11 mission that culminated witch Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. 
It was a seminal moment."I remember watching it on our living room TV, and the excitement of my parents and my grandparents,"
he says. "Little kids can pick up that kind of excitement. They know something extraordinary is happening.
That definitely became a passion of mine."
Among other things, his exhilaration about space turned him into one of those hard-core Star Trek fans who knows every episode.

At his montessori preschool Bezos was already fanatically focused. "The teacher complained to my mother that I was too task focused and that she couldn't get me to switch tasks, so she would have to just pick up my chair and move me,
"he recalls."And by the way, if you ask the people who work with me, that's still probably true today."

In 1974, when he was ten, his passion for Star Trek led him to computers. He discovered that he could pay a space video game on the terminal in the computer room of his elementary school in Houston, where his father was working for Exxon.
This was in the days before personal computers, and a dial-up modem connected the school's computer terminal to the mainframe of a company that had donated its excess computer time.
”We had a teletype that was connected by and old acoustic modem," Bezos says. 
"You literally dialed a regular phone and picked up the handset and put it in this little cradle. 
And nobody--none of the teachers knew how to operate this computer,nobody did. But there was a stack of manuals, and me and a couple of other kids stayed after class and learned how to program this thing....
And then, we learned that the mainframe programmers in some central location somewhere in Houston had already programmed this computer to play Star Trek."

His mother encouraged his love of electronics and mechanics by shuttling him to and from RadioShack and letting him turn the family garage into a science project lab.
She even indulged his penchant for creating ingenious booby traps to frighten his younger brother and sister.
"I was constantly booby-trapping the house with various kinds of alarms and some of them were not just audible sounds,
but actually like physical booby traps,"he says. "My mom is a saint,because she would drive me to RadioShack multiple times a day."

His childhood business heroes where Thomas Edison adn Walt Disney."I've always been interested in inventors and invention."
he says. Even though Edison was the more prolific inventor, Bezos came to admire Disney more because of the audacity of his vision.
"It seemed to me that he had this incredible capability to create a vision that he could get a large number of people to share,
"Thing that Disney invented, like Disneyland, the theme parks, they were such big visions that no single individual could ever pull them off,unlike a lot of the things that Edison worked on. Walt Disney really was able to get a big team of people working a concerted direction."

By the time he was in hight school,his family had moved to Miami. Bezos was a straight-A student, somewhat nerdy,and still completely obsessed with space exploration. He was chosen as the valedictorian of this class,and his speech was about space:
how to colonize planets, build space hotels, and save our fragile planet by finding other places to do manufacturing.
"Space, the final frontier,meet me there!" he concluded.

He went to Princeton with the goal of studying physics.It sounded like a smart plan until he smashed into a course on quantum mechanics. One day he and his roommate were trying to solve a particularly difficult partial differential equation, and they went to the room of another person in the class for help.
He stared at in for a moment, then game them the answer. Bezos was amazed that the student had done the calculation--which took three pages of detailed algebra to explain--in his head. "That was the very moment when I realized I was never going to be a great theoretical physicist," Bezos says." I saw the writing on the wall, and I changed my major very quickly to electrical engineering and computer science. "It was a difficult realization. His heart had been set on becoming a physicist,
but finally he had confronted his own limits.

After graduation Bezos went to New York to apply his computer skills to the financial industry.
He ended up a hedge fund run by David E.Shaw, which used computer algorithms to discover pricing disparities in the financial markets.
Bezos took to the work with disciplined zeal. Foreshadowing the workplace fanaticism he would later try to instill at Amazon,
he kept a sleeping bag in his office in case he wanted to sleep there after a late night of work.

While working at the hedge fund in 1994,Bezos came across the statistic that the web had been growing by moe than 2,300 percent each year.
He decided that he wanted to get aboard that rocket, and he came up with the idea of opening a retail store online, sort of a Sears catalogue for the digital age.
Realizing that it was prudent to start with one product, he chose books--partly because he liked them and also because they were not perishable, were a commodity,could be bought from two big wholesale distributors.
And there were more than three million titles in print--far more than a bricks-and-mortar store could possibly keep on display.

When he told David Shaw that he wanted to leave the hedge fund to pursue this idea,Shaw took him on a two-hour walk through Central Park. "You know what, Jeft this is a really good idea. I think you're onto a good idea here but this would be abetter idea for somebody who didn't already hae a good job." 
He convinced Bezos to think about it for a couple of days before making a decision.Bezos then consulted his wife,Mackenzie, whom he had met at the hedge fund and married the year before."You know you can count me in 100 percent,whatever you want to do,"she said.

To make the decision, Bezos a mental exercise that would become a famous part of his risk-calculation process.
He called it a  "regret minimization framework." He would imagine what he would feel when he turned eighty and thought back to the decision.
"I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have,"he explains."I knew that when I was eighty,I was not going to regret having tried this.I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal.
I knew that if I failed, I would't regret that,but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried.
I knew that that would haunt me every day."

He and MacKenzie flew to Texas,where they borrowed a Chevrolet from Jeft's father and began a drive that would become legendary in entrepreneurial origin tales.
As MacKenzie drove, Jeft typed up a business plan and spreadsheets filled with revenue predictions.
"You know the business plan won't survive its first encounters with reality,"he says."But the discipline of writing the plan forces think through some of the issues and to get sort of mentally comfortable in the space.
Then you start to understand,if you push on this knob,this will move over here and so on.So,that's the first step."

Bezos picked Seattle as a location for his new company, partly because it was home to Microsoft and many other tech companies and therefore had a lot of engineers to recruit from.
It was also near a book distribution company.Bezos wanted to incorporate right away,so on the drive he called a friend to get a recommendation for a lawyer in Seattle.
It turned out to be the friend's divorce lawyer, but he was able to handle the parers.
Bezos told the lawyer he wanted to call the new company Cadabra, as in the magical incantation "aberacadabra."
The lawyer responded,"Cadaver?" Bezos unleashed his trademark boom of a laugh and realized he would need to comp up with a better name.
He eventually decided to name what he hoped would be the Earth's largest store after the Earth's longest river.

When he called his father to tell him what he was doing,Mike Bezos asked, "What's the Internet?"Or at least that's Jeft's romantic narrative. Mike Bezos in fact had been a user of the early online dial-up services and had a pretty good idea of what online retailing could be.
Event though he and Jackie thought it was rash to leave a high-paying financial industry job for such a lark, they took much of their life savings--$100,000 at first,then more--and agreed to invest. "The initial start-up capital came primary from my parents, and they invested a large faction of their life savings in what became Amazon.com,"Bezos says."That was a very bold and trusting thing for them to do."

Mike Bezos admitted that he never understood either the concept or the business plan.
"He was making a bet on his son,as was my mother,"Jeft says."I told them that I told them that I though there was a 70 percent chance that they would lose their whole investment....I thought I was giving myself triple the normal odds,because really,if you look at the odds of a start-up company succeeding at all,it's only about 10 percent.
Here I was, giving myself a 30 percent chance." As his mother,Jackie, later said,"We didn't invest in Amazon, we invested in Jeft."
They eventually put in more money, ended up owning 6 percent of the company, and used their wealth to become very active and creative philanthropists focused on providing early-childhood learning opportunities for all children.

Others didn't quite get the idea either.Crag Stoltz was then a Wahington Post reporter running the news-paper's magazine about consumer technology.Bezos came to pitch his idea."He was short,with an uncomfortable smile,thinning hair,and a somehow febrile affect,"Stoltz later wrote in a blog post.
Totally unimpressed,Stoltz blew him off and declined to write a story about the idea.
Years later, long after Stoltz left the paper,Bezos would end up buying it.

Jeft and MacKenzie initially set up the company in the two-bedroom home they rented near Seattle.
"They converted the garage into a work space and brought in three Sun workstations,"Josh Quittener later wrote in Time.
"Extension cords snaked from every available outlet in the house to the garage ,and a black hole gaped through the ceiling--this was where a potbellied stove had been ripped out to make more room.
To sae money, Bezos went to Home Depot and bought three wooden doors.Using angle brackets and 2-by-4s,he hammered together three desks,at a cost of $60 each."

Amazon.com went live on July 16,1995. Bezos and his small team rigged up a bell to chime whenever they got a sale,but it very quickly needed to be disabled, as rushes of orders came in.
In the first month,with no real marketing or publicity plan other than asking friends to spread the word,
Amazon scored sales in all fifty sates and in forty-five countries."Within the first few day,I knew this was going to be huge,"Bezos told Time.
"It was obvious that we were onto something much bigger than we ever dared to hope."

At first Jeft and MacKenzie and a few early employees handled everything, including packing,wrapping, and driving the boxes off to be shipped."We had so many orders that we weren't ready for that we had no real organization in our distribution center at all,"Bezos says."In fact, we were packing on our hands and kness on hard concrete floor."
One of the other iconic origin tales of Amazon,told often by Bezos with his raucous laugh,involved how they figured out a way to make the packing easier.
